# CV of Louis TSAI Tsz Ho

Since CV is still very much how the world works, I'm not going to make CV anytime soon. But what I can do is to bring my process of how I make my CV a little bit more transparent. It also works very well to help me (and whoever's interested) to keep track of my growth over the years.
